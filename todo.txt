1. Performance & Best Practices
Image Optimization:
Use the Image component’s priority prop only for above-the-fold images (e.g., your hero/about photo). For others, use loading='lazy'.
Make sure all images (project images, profile photo) are optimized in size and format (WebP/optimized JPEG/PNG).
SVG Favicon:
SVG favicons are great, but for maximum browser compatibility, also generate a favicon.ico and add it to your public/ folder.
Environment Variables:
Never commit .env.local to git. Double-check your .gitignore.
API Security:
For the contact form, consider adding basic spam protection (e.g., a honeypot field, rate limiting, or a simple CAPTCHA).
Validate and sanitize all inputs on the backend.
2. UI/UX & Design
Responsiveness:
Test on mobile and tablet. Make sure all sections (especially modals and grids) look good and are scrollable on small screens.
Accessibility:
Add aria-labels to all interactive elements (buttons, links).
Ensure color contrast is sufficient for readability.
Use semantic HTML where possible (e.g., <main>, <section>, <nav>, <footer>).
Animations:
The typewriter effect is great! Consider adding subtle hover/active effects to buttons and cards for more interactivity.
For modals, add a fade-in/fade-out animation for a smoother experience.
Consistent Button Styles:
Make sure all buttons (including those in modals, project links, etc.) use a consistent style and spacing.
PDF Modal:
Add a loading spinner while the PDF is loading, and a fallback message if it fails to load.
3. Content & Structure
SEO:
Add meta tags for description, Open Graph, and Twitter cards in your layout for better sharing and search engine results.
Use descriptive alt text for all images.
Project Links:
If a project doesn’t have a live demo, consider hiding the button or disabling it.
Contact Form:
Add client-side validation for email format and required fields for instant feedback.
Show a success message that auto-dismisses after a few seconds.
404 Page:
Add a custom 404 page for a more branded experience.
4. Code Quality
Component Reuse:
If you find yourself repeating button or card code, consider making reusable components.
TypeScript:
If not already, use TypeScript for all components and API routes for better type safety.
Dependencies:
Remove any unused npm packages to keep your bundle size small.
5. Nice-to-Have Features
Dark/Light Mode Toggle:
If you want to appeal to more users, add a toggle for dark/light mode.
Scroll-to-Top Button:
For long pages, a floating scroll-to-top button improves navigation.
Analytics:
Add Google Analytics or Plausible to track visits (if you care about stats).
